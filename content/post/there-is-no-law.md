There is no law  
Besides this one  
No pets allowed  
He read and frowned

For how shall I  
Have fashion hair  
Without a bird  
On my head up there?

Now all the children  
Laughed and played  
Their birds were false  
But his was fake

I wrote this in response to a timed prompt where we had two minutes to write a poem starting with the line “There is no law”
